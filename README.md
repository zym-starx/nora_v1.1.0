# nora_v1.1.0

A voluntary summer internship's project. Made with NVIDIA's Riva. 

This repository includes all my attempts. The "main working one" is main.py. 
Riva should be downloaded and run on port: 50051 to run this. 
ASR-NLP-TTS models should be included to the download of Riva by changing the **config file of Riva**. 

In nlp models BERT (weather) one should be enough since this project only answers to that topic.

If you do not include the location in your query it automatically get that info from your computer. (Nothing to worry, there is no privacy violation :) )

"acts" are for answer diversity.
